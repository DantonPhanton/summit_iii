1. Clone the project 
2. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the Github project 
   - Ex. cd FOLDER_NAME\FOLDER_NAME
3. `npm install --global expo-cli` to install the expo CLI
   - The installation may take some time
4. `npm install` to install dependencies for the project
5. Replace the config.js file with the one [provided](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jn6XMsHN1jCmgrD3UgFbHFVRzjXB_zxh/view)
   - Found in summit_iii\src\firebase
6. `npm start` to run the application

If there are any issues with npm (step 3) consider installing yarn:

- `yarn global add expo-cli` to install the expo CLI
- `yarn install` to install dependencies for the project
